[{"name": "Full English omelette", "description": "The full breakfast is a great British institution. Loads of flavours that set you up for an action packed day. I set out to make this diet friendly and the result is a brilliant weekend treat for dieters. Now this is a BIG breakfast, even when it\u2019s comprised of low calorie, highly filling foods. But because of all the protein going on it\u2019ll keep you full for ages. When I make this as brunch for my family we skip lunch which keeps our overall daily calorie intake in check. If you get hungry later on, have a small snack like a salad or a piece of fruit.", "url": "http://allrecipes.co.uk/recipe/40096/full-english-omelette.aspx", "image": "//ukcdn.ar-cdn.com/recipes/originalxl/e1696136-0e40-42bc-a84f-461f57bca116.jpg", "rating": 0.5, "recipe_url": "http://allrecipes.co.uk/recipe/40096/full-english-omelette.aspx"}, {"name": "Full English breakfast", "description": "Nothing beats a full English breakfast.
