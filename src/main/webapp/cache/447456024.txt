Open and add a good grind of pepper (or other alternative seasonings).

Roll each amount into a ball in your hands (the mixture is very tacky right now) and then flatten and shape by pressing out to about 1.5-2cm deep. This will make 2 very big burgers.", "Place in the preheated pan and cook for about 5 minutes before turning over.
