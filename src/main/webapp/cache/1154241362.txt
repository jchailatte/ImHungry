Combine the grated potato with two egg yolks in a bowl. Season with some salt and pepper; mix together well. Set aside until you cook the hash browns.", "Heat a pan over a medium-low heat. Add the beans, tomato and mushrooms; cover with a lid and simmer until the mushrooms are cooked.", "Once the mushrooms are cooked, take the lid off and simmer until the liquid has reduced and you have a thick sauce.", "Slice the sausages and add to the sauce. Keep the sauce hot until needed.", "To cook the hash browns: Spray a non-stick frying pan and heat it over medium heat. Add the potato and spread out to a thin layer. Cook for about 10 mins until golden brown, flip over and cook the other side until golden brown.", "Crack 3 eggs into a bowl and season with salt and pepper. Using a fork whisk it briskly until the egg whites turn white instead of translucent.", "Heat a non-stick frying pan over medium heat and spray with cooking spray.", "Add the eggs to the pan and keep it moving for the first 30-60 seconds by shaking the pan and stirring the egg with a silicone spatula. Some lumps will appear similar to scrambled egg, this is ok but stop while there is still enough liquid egg in the pan to form a flat omelette.", "Using the silicone spatula, push any egg down from the edges of the pan. Cook until the edges of the egg dry up. Gently slide the spatula under the edges of the egg until it's completely loose from the pan. If it resists or tears, stop, let it cook a little longer and try again.", "When the egg starts to dry up on top scoop some filling onto one half. Slide the filled side first onto a plate and fold the other side over it. Slice the hash brown and lay on top. Finish with a drizzle of brown sauce."], "name": "Full English omelette", "prep_time": "10 min", "cook_time": "10 min", "rating": 5.0, "recipe_url": "http://allrecipes.co.uk/recipe/40096/full-english-omelette.aspx"}
