I configured the front-end build configuration and modernized the search page UI with Peter.
Currently, the build is only running on Peterâ€™s machine so it is difficult for me to check the work done.
I will begin modernizing the UI of the restaurant and recipe pages and work with Peter to generate proper links between pages and integration with the backend.

Since the last meeting, I was able to set up a mock database in an xml file for testing purposes.
There are no current obstacles.
I plan to continue writing DBUnit test cases to achieve 100% code coverage on Java code that interacts with the MySQL database.

Justin and I configured a mock database and were able to connect to the xml to initiate testing. Harrison and I started work on Google API changes
Tests are yet to be made for mock database and Harrison and I had trouble finishing test cases for the Google API change with radius.
Justin and I will continue writing tests for 100% code coverage of database, and Harrison and I will fix the Google changes.

Harrison Weinerman
I started to implement the change to Google API to take in distance parameter with Sam.
Sam and I ran into issues getting tests to run for the radius control.
We will continue to iron out the issues we had setting search radius for restaurant results.

Peter Yang
I configured front end build configuration and modernized the search page, in conformance with the existing cucumber tests.
The build process that was currently set up is very slow and an alternative to speed it up would improve productivity and help meet the goal faster.
I will begin modernizing the results page and ensure they link out to the legacy recipe page, restaurant page, and list management page.
