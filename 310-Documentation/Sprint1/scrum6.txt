Jonathan Chai
I finished the Restaurant and Recipe pages.
There was no obstacles.
I will look into Fabric for components to implement further features.

Justin Lam
I wrote test cases for maintaining recipe data past a single session.
The Recipes API is down so I canâ€™t test directly inserting from the API to the database.
I will complete the database testing code with Samuel, and finish the Sprint 1 Report.

Samuel Rosas-Meza
Continued working on database testing with Justin and documentation of best practices independently.
No obstacles at this time.
I will complete database testing with Justin, commit test code and finish documentation.

Harrison Weinerman
Sam and I updated the API keys and confirmed existing tests run properly.
There are no obstacles.
I will finish documentation with the rest of the team.

Peter Yang
I finished modernizing the list management page with each of the control items working.
The previous issues with Cucumber IDs persists since using `mergeStyleSets` uses non deterministic id generation so when more code gets written the IDs will change. Additionally, the recipe endpoint appears to have gone down.
I will ensure the project is properly integrated with the other new features my teammates worked on before the Monday demonstration.
