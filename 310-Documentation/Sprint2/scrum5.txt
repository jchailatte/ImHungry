Stand Up
Harrison Weinerman
I fixed and merged the PR with radius improvements/tests and then worked with Justin on improved ListManagement test cases.
There are no obstacles.
I will work on pagination of the Restaurant class.

Samuel Rosas-Meza
I worked on documenting programming session, simple design explanations and diagrams to justify simplicity of feature implementations.
There are no major obstacles.
I will finish the simplicity explanation, verify all commit and travis links, and work on refactoring details.

Jonathan Chai
I finished the pagination of the front-end and worked with Peter on the implementation of the registration and login system.
I will be attending HackSC which will probably prevent me from working over the weekend.
I will finish integrating the pagination back-end with the frontend and complete cucumber tests.

Peter Yang
I finished the backend implementation of the User registration / login system and plugged in persistent data to be associated with the users. Additionally, I worked on various refactoring.
The ListManagement module was not thoroughly tested which led to some issues regarding the implementation of saving lists to specific users.
Though I will be attending HackSC I will make an attempt to work on the grocery list and reordering saved lists provided the prerequisite of the backend working for these components are completed by then.

Justin Lam
I wrote/fixed the ListManagement test cases and they all run properly now. I also wrote functions for managing grocery lists.
There are no major obstacles. However, all branches are not merged and itâ€™s difficult to check functionality overall.
I will write test cases for grocery lists. I will continue to test/code an implementation that allows any of the three predetermined lists to be reordered.
