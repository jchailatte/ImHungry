Stand Up
Harrison Weinerman
I finished the pagination of the restaurants. 
There are no obstacles
I will write tests for the implementation of the grocery list.

Samuel Rosas-Meza
I wrote the GroceryListTest class to run Grocery List methods that Justin created. GroceryListTest tested for insert, remove, and update methods to grocery lists and ingredient checklists. 
There are no obstacles. 
I will finish documentation and JUnit testing for reordering of lists. 

Jonathan Chai
I did not do anything, I was attending HackSC and was not able to work on anything since the last scrum. 
Working during the hackathon on this project was difficult due to lack of time or rest.
I will prepare tests for the pagination and add to grocery list button and code the already developed psuedo-code.

Peter Yang
I was unable to work on any task while at HackSC.
The hackathon environment over the weekend provided little time for rest or additional work.
I will do a basic implementation of the grocery list and list management rearrangement for demonstration for the next elicitation.

Justin Lam
I created a GroceryList class, wrote methods to properly insert,update, and retrieve this information from the database with Samuel. All test cases for the GroceryList class are written and passed. I also fixed previous issues with duplicate entries in the database. 
There are no obstacles.
I will write/test code that accomplishes the list reordering and finish up documentation for the Sprint 2 Report.
