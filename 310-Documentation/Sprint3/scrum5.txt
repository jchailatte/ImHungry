Stand Up
Harrison Weinerman
I finished the caching refactor for NetworkReader.
There are no obstacles.
I will continue to work on documentation with the team.

Samuel Rosas-Meza
I worked on finishing documentation and configuring environment for demo.
There are no obstacles.
Verify all items in Sprint Report prior to submission.

Jonathan Chai
I worked on documentation and improved cucumber tests for more test cases.
There are no obstacles.
I will check over the Sprint Report.

Peter Yang
I finished the implementation of list reordering. You can now drag and drop items on the list management page and the ordering is persistent.
The cucumber documentation regarding drag and drop was not clear but I eventually managed to figure out how to make it work.
I will “study” for the CSCI 310 final.

Justin Lam
I fixed minor bugs, fixed broken test cases after merging code, and added merging functionality for grocery list items.
There are no obstacles at the moment.
I will look over the Sprint 3 Report.
