Stand Up
Harrison Weinerman
I didn’t make progress on the API credit/mock refactor.
I got sick and didn’t get to continue working on what I expected to.
I will continue working on the refactor to resolve the saving issue so we can cache network responses.’

Samuel Rosas-Meza
I worked on simple design best practices based on refactors by Justin and Harrison.
There are no obstacles.
I will continue to assist in the development of tests and any backend changes and keep document updated.

Jonathan Chai
I did nothing.
There are no obstacles.
I will continue to update and refactor existing tests to have them cover more cases.

Peter Yang
I did code reviews of all existing pull requests so that they can be merged into master for the next stand up.
Some of the refactors had some breaking changes so some of the pull requests had to be sent back for changes.
I will finish all the front end integration for the features on my Asana tasks regarding list reordering and others.

Justin Lam
I researched different ways to merge similar grocery list items.
There are no obstacles at the moment.
I will continue implementing/testing the merging of similar individual grocery list items.
