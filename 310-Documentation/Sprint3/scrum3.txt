Stand Up
Harrison Weinerman
I started to work on refactoring NetworkReader to cache API responses to not use as many credits with Travis with Justin.
Right now the refactor is commented out and not working yet since the files we are trying to cache and save will not save correctly. I think something is wrong with relative/absolute paths.
I will continue work on this mock for Restaurant/Recipe data to use less API credits.

Samuel Rosas-Meza
I verified coverage for junit tests for persistence across features and kept documentation up to date with sessions, scrums, and refactoring.
There are no obstacles.
I will continue to keep the report document up to date and assist with the backend updates or additions of tests.

Jonathan Chai
I completed the function for allowing the user to search after clicking on a search history item.
There are no obstacles.
I will update and refactor existing tests to have them cover more cases.

Peter Yang
While working with Justin to integrate some of the list ordering functionality, we also refactored some of the GroceryList and ListManagement classes out into smaller managable chunks.
There is some difficulty merging the grocery list items since it requires “interpreting” the text of the ingredients, but we may be able to use a spoonacular API to assist with that.
I will finish the integration of list management in line with the existing backend changes.

Justin Lam
I researched different ways to merge similar grocery list items and refactored the GroceryList class to be separated from the very large ListManagement class and worked with Harrison on the mock.
It’s been difficult to implement the merging of grocery list items in the Grocery list.
I will implement the merging of similar individual grocery list items.
