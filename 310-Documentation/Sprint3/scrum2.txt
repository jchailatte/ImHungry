Stand Up

Harrison Weinerman
I refactored Restaurant class and made a RestaurantFactory in process.
There are no obstacles.
I will work on making a mock for Restaurant data to use API credits less.

Samuel Rosas-Meza
I worked on updating existing GroceryList tests to conform with Justin’s updated methods.
There are no obstacles.
I will work on creating additional tests for data persistence and maintaining documentation.

Jonathan Chai
I completed pagination for the recipes as well as fixed the UI requirements stated during the elicitation.
There are no obstacles.
I will apply pagination to the restaurants side and try and make the search history on click.

Peter Yang
Though I initially planned to work speed up the recipe search results, it was not high priority so instead I worked with Harrison to refactor the Restaurant class since we intend to utilize more of the functionality later so it is important the code is reusable.
The CI build temporarily broke due to an API configuration issue but it was shortly resolved and should not come back.
Since Justin has completed the backend functionality for reordering I will now be able to implement the frontend for reordering list items.

Justin Lam
I updated all of the GroceryList methods on the back end that implements removing single ingredient items from the user’s grocery list. In addition, I implemented/tested the rearranging lists functionality with 100% code coverage.
It’s been difficult to implement the merging of grocery list items in the Grocery list.
I will refactor the ListManagement class and continue looking for a way to implement the merging of similar individual grocery list items.
