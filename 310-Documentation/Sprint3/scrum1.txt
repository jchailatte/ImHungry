Stand Up

Harrison Weinerman
I worked on the documentation for our Sprint 2 submission.
There are no obstacles.
I will work on refactoring the Restaurant class.

Samuel Rosas-Meza
I worked on Review and Retrospective, Planning, and Report documentation.
There are no obstacles.
I will work with Justin on updating list management and grocery list methods.

Jonathan Chai
I worked on the Sprint 2 documentation.
There are no obstacles.
I will work on updating the UI to match with the updated requirements.

Peter Yang
Yesterday, I looked at fixing the merge issues that resulted in the tests to fail during the demo.
Cucumber tests were not working for some reason so they were disabled for the time being.
I will refactor the search capability so it becomes much faster (run tasks in parallel instead of waiting linearly).

Justin Lam
I wrote the Sprint Review & Retrospective document and the Sprint planning document.
There are currently no obstacles.
I will refactor the ListManagement class, update the GroceryList functionality to be able to remove individual items, and begin to write code for reordering lists.
